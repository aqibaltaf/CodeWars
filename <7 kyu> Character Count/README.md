<h2><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/56786a687e9a88d1cf00005d">Character Count</a></h2>
<pre>
You are going to be given a word. Your job will be to make sure that each character in that word has the exact same number of 
occurrences. You will return <b>true</b> if it is valid, or <b>false</b> if it is not.
&nbsp
For this kata, capitals are considered the same as lowercase letters. Therefore: "A" == "a"

The input is a string (with no spaces) containing [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9] and common symbols. The length will be 0 < length < 100.</pre>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>"abcabc" is a valid word because "a" appears twice, "b" appears twice, and"c" appears twice.
"abcabcd" is NOT a valid word because "a" appears twice, "b" appears twice, "c" appears twice, but "d" only appears once!
"123abc!" is a valid word because all of the characters only appear once in the word.</pre>
