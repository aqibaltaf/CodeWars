<h2><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/570597e258b58f6edc00230d/python">Remove First and Last Character</a></h2>


<pre>You are given a string containing a sequence of character sequences separated by commas.

Write a function which returns a new string containing the same character except the first and last one but separated by spaces.

If the input string is empty or the removal of the first and last items would cause the resulting string to be empty, 
return an empty value (represented as a generic value NULL in the examples below).</pre>

<h2>Examples: </h2>
<pre>"1,2,3"      =>  "2"
"1,2,3,4"    =>  "2 3"
"1,2,3,4,5"  =>  "2 3 4"
&nbsp
""     =>  NULL
"1"    =>  NULL
"1,2"  =>  NULL</pre>
